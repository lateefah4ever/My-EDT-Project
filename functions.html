                <li>
                    <span class="rdd">Processor Management:</span> An operating system manages the processor's work by allocating various jobs to it and 
                    ensuring that each process receives enough time from the processor to function properly.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="blu">Memory Management:</span>  An operating system manages the allocation and deallocation of the memory to various 
                    processes and ensures that the other process does not consume the memory allocated to one process.
                </li>

                    <span class="rdd">Device Management:</span> There are various input and output devices. An OS controls the working of these input-output 
                    devices. It receives the requests from these devices, performs a specific task, and communicates back to the requesting process.
                </li>

                    <span class="rdd">Security:</span>  The operating system provides various techniques which assure the integrity and confidentiality of 
                    user data. Following security measures are used to protect user data:

                    <li>Protection against unauthorized access through login.</li>
                    <li>Protection against intrusion by keeping Firefall active.</li>
                    <li>Protecting the system memory against malicious access.</li>
                    <li>Displaying messages related to system vulnerabilities.</li>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="rdd">Error Detection:</span> From time to time, the operating system checks the system for any external threat or malicious 
                    software activity. It also checks the hardware for any type of damage. This process displays several alerts to the user so 
                    that the appropriate action can be taken against any damage caused to the system. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="blu">Job Scheduling:</span> In a multitasking OS where multiple programs run simultaneously, the operating system determines 
                    which applications should run in which order and how time should be allocated to each application.
