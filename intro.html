            <p>
                An <span class="optt">operating</span> <span class="stem">system</span> <strong>(OS)</strong> manages all other applications 
                and programs in a computer, and it is loaded into the computer by a boot program. It enables applications to interact with a 
                computer's hardware. Through a designated application programme interface, the application programmes request services from 
                the operating system <strong>(API).</strong><br><br>
                The kernel is the software that contains the operating system's core components. To run other programmes, every computer has 
                to have at least one operating system installed. <span class="exz">Windows, Linux, and Android are examples of operating 
                systems</span> that enable the user to use programs like MS Office, Notepad, and games on the computer or mobile phone. It 
                is necessary to have at least one operating system installed in the computer to run basic programs like browsers.
