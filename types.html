                    Batch OS is the first operating system for second-generation computers. This OS does not directly interact with the computer. 
                    Instead, an operator takes up similar jobs and groups them together into a batch, and then these batches are executed one by 
                    one based on the first-come, first, serve principle.

                    A distributed OS is a recent advancement in the field of computer technology and is utilized all over the world that too 
                    with great pace. In a distributed OS, various computers are connected through a single communication channel. These 
                    independent computers have their memory unit and CPU and are known as loosely coupled systems. The system processes can be 
                    of different sizes and can perform different functions. The major benefit of such a type of operating system is that a user 
                    can access files that are not present on his system but in another connected system. In addition, remote access is available 
                    to the systems connected to this network.

                    The multitasking OS is also known as the time-sharing operating system as each task is given some time so that all the tasks 
                    work efficiently.  This system provides access to a large number of users, and each user gets the time of CPU as they get in 
                    a single system. The tasks performed are given by a single user or by different users. The time allotted to execute one task 
                    is called a quantum, and as soon as the time to execute one task is completed, the system switches over to another task.

                    Network operating systems are the systems that run on a server and manage all the networking functions. They allow sharing 
                    of various files, applications, printers, security, and other networking functions over a small network of computers like 
                    LAN or any other private network. In the network OS, all the users are aware of the configurations of every other user 
                    within the network, which is why network operating systems are also known as tightly coupled systems.

                            unacceptable. The time constraints of such applications are very strict. Such systems are built for life-saving 
                            equipment like parachutes and airbags, which immediately need to be in action if an accident happens.

                            The soft real-time OS is the operating system for applications where time constraint is not very strict.
                            In a soft real-time system, an important task is prioritized over less important tasks, and this priority remains 
                            active until the completion of the task. Furthermore, a time limit is always set for a specific job, enabling short 
                            time delays for future tasks, which is acceptable. For Example, virtual reality, reservation systems, etc.
